This is the first person game you play as detective Sam and his loyal companion dog Cooper together you try to get to the mansion and discover the mysteries within the island.
A mysterious letter, unsigned but sealed with the emblem of the long-abandoned Ashbourne Mansion, calls him to investigate a string
of unexplained disappearances. Sam arrives by boat with his loyal dog, Cooper, only to find the mansion's towering gates locked and unwelcoming. With
no way inside, Sam is forced to explore the surrounding island, overgrown forests, forgotten ruins, and decaying structures
litter the terrain. As Sam searches for clues and the Master Key to the mansion, he is stalked by giant, shadowy spiders, unlike anything
seen before, aggressive and unnervingly intelligent. Cooper aids Sam by searching for the key. Together, they must
uncover the truth buried on the island
